**e-Yantra Robotics Competition (2020)**
**Project: Autonomous Drone for Parcel Delivery**

This was a national-level e-Yantra Robotics Competition, where we were challenged to develop a drone capable of delivering parcels across a cityâ€”a fascinating and complex problem.

**Project Overview**
We explored drone control and navigation through simulations, focusing on improving efficiency and safety for urban deliveries. Utilizing ROS (Robot Operating System) and the Gazebo simulator, I integrated algorithms to tackle issues like drone crashes and delivery speed optimization.

**Development Process**
**Obstacle Avoidance:** Extended and implemented an obstacle avoidance algorithm to navigate the drone safely through urban environments filled with buildings and bridges.
Delivery Scheduling: Developed a scheduling algorithm to optimize delivery times, enhancing the drone's ability to deliver more parcels in less time.
**Simulation and Testing:** Conducted extensive tests in simulated environments to ensure reliable navigation and successful delivery performance.
***Achievements**
Our optimized system significantly outperformed many other teams, placing us in the top 20 out of 350 national competitors. This project was a key learning experience in drone control, real-time problem-solving, and teamwork.
