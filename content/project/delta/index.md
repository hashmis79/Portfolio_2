**Delta Electronics Automation Contest (March 2021)**
Project: Gantry-Based System for Efficient Segregation and Packaging

In March 2021,i was part of a team participated in the Delta Electronics Automation Contest, where we submitted a proposal to address the challenge of efficiently segregating and packaging different-sized boxes in a warehouse setting.

**Project Overview**
Our solution proposed a gantry-based system designed to perform pick, place, and sorting operations for various box sizes. The system aimed to maximize volume occupancy inside a larger container using a vision system to determine the size and orientation of the boxes.

**Development Process**
**Design and Research:** We refined our gantry robot design through consultations with professors and industry experts.
**Manufacturing:** After finalizing the design, we employed different manufacturing techniques to produce the parts. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, we successfully fabricated and assembled the robot.

**Achievements**
Despite the obstacles, we secured the Second Category Prize and ranked in the Top 40 globally.
