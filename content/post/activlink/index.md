abstract: End-effectors in a robotic system generally have the role of executing operations related to manipulating and handling the objects. The traditional grippers are restricted to the scope of performing a specific task, which limits their capability of adapting to changes in the physical properties of the objects. The grippers can become more efficient when integrated with a sub-system catering to manipulating varied-sized objects within the existing gripper workspace. Many state-of-the-art methods have used tendon-based and active surface (belt-driven) actuation techniques to effectively change the pose of a wide range of objects within the gripper (in hand). We propose the design of a gripper system that leverages the role of an active surface-based actuation technique integrated with an underactuated linkage mechanism capable of performing complex manipulations. We have curated an object list, all having different shapes, and executed experimental rotation and translation of objects. We take the help of vision-based feedback to accurately execute targeted goal pose motion and additionally demonstrate the gripper's response to mechanical stresses (through analysis) and grasping an object through torque feedback.

<!-- Create a personal knowledge base and share your knowledge with your peers.

Hugo Blox web framework empowers you with one of the most flexible note-taking capabilities out there.

Create a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.

Use it as your second brain, either publicly sharing your knowledge with your peers via your website, or via a private GitHub repository and password-protected site just for yourself.

## Mindmaps

Hugo Blox supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.

With this open format, can even edit your mindmaps in other popular tools such as Obsidian.

Simply insert a Markdown code block labelled as `markmap` and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.

Mindmaps can be created by simply writing the items as a Markdown list within the `markmap` code block, indenting each item to create as many sub-levels as you need:

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```
</code>
</pre>
</div>

renders as

```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```

Anh here's a more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:

```

## Highlighting

<mark>Highlight</mark> important text with `mark`:

```html
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
```

## Callouts

Use [callouts](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/#callouts) (aka _asides_, _hints_, or _alerts_) to draw attention to notes, tips, and warnings.

By wrapping a paragraph in `{{%/* callout note */%}} ... {{%/* /callout */%}}`, it will render as an aside.

```markdown
{{%/* callout note */%}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{%/* /callout */%}}
```

renders as

{{% callout note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

Or use the `warning` callout type so your readers don't miss critical details:

{{% callout warning %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}
